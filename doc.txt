This File is Created in Local repo with a Branch "master" before cloning or connecting to a Remote repo [Which is now Empty]

git remote add remoteRepo https://github.com/Gowtham209/test.git
git push -u remoteRepo    master
            RepoName     LocalBranchName 


Important:
-u: This flag stands for --set-upstream. 
It sets the remote branch as the upstream branch for the local branch.
This means that future git push and git pull commands will know which 
remote branch to interact with by default.
